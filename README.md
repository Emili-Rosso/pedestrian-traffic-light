# pedestrian-traffic-light


This project implements a traffic light system for vehicles and pedestrians using Arduino. The system includes a pedestrian request button that allows pedestrians to safely cross at a crosswalk. When the button is pressed, the vehicle traffic light changes its state and the pedestrian traffic light is activated. 
A 7-segment display is used to show the remaining crossing time, helping pedestrians know how long they have to cross safely. In general, it demonstrates basic concepts such as digital input handling, timing control without blocking execution, and state-based logic.
