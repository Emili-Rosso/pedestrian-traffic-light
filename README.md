# 🚦 Pedestrian Traffic Light System
  
This project implements a pedestrian traffic light system using an Arduino. The system allows pedestrians to safely cross the street by pressing a request button, which triggers a sequence of traffic light changes for vehicles and pedestrians. A 7-segment display shows the remaining crossing time, giving pedestrians clear feedback on how long they have to cross safely.

It demonstrates the use of digital input handling, non-blocking timing control, and state-based logic in Arduino programming. It is a practical example of how to combine sensors, outputs, and timing in embedded systems.

# 🛠️ Components 

  • Arduino Uno (or compatible board);

  •	3 LEDs for vehicle traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green);

  •	2 LEDs for pedestrian traffic lights (Red, Green);

  •	7-segment display;

  •	Push button (pedestrian request);

  •	Resistors (for LEDs and button pull-down);

  •	Breadboard and jumper wires.

# ⚙️ How It Works
# 1.	Normal Operation:

  •	Vehicle traffic light remains green while no pedestrian request is made.(🟢)

  • Pedestrian light remains red. (🔴)


# 2.	Pedestrian Request:

  •	When the pedestrian presses the button, the system waits for a safe moment to interrupt the vehicle green light. (🔘) 

  •	Vehicle lights change to yellow and then red. (🟡 -> 🔴) 

  •	Pedestrian light turns green, and the 7-segment display shows the remaining crossing time. (🟢 + ⏱️) 


# 3.	Crossing Timer:

  •	The pedestrian has 10 seconds to cross. (🚶)

  •	The 7-segment display shows a countdown from 9 to 0, indicating the remaining time to cross safely. (🔢) 


  # 4.	Return to Normal:

  •	After the timer ends, pedestrian light turns red. (🟢 -> 🔴)

  •	Vehicle light returns to green, resuming normal operation. (🔴 -> 🟢)
