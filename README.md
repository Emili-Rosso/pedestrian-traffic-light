# pedestrian-traffic-light
 
    Description 
This project implements a pedestrian traffic light system using an Arduino. The system allows pedestrians to safely cross the street by pressing a request button, which triggers a sequence of traffic light changes for vehicles and pedestrians. A 7-segment display shows the remaining crossing time, giving pedestrians clear feedback on how long they have to cross safely.

It demonstrates the use of digital input handling, non-blocking timing control, and state-based logic in Arduino programming. It is a practical example of how to combine sensors, outputs, and timing in embedded systems.

    Components 

  • Arduino Uno (or compatible board);

  •	3 LEDs for vehicle traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green);

  •	2 LEDs for pedestrian traffic lights (Red, Green);

  •	7-segment display;

  •	Push button (pedestrian request);

  •	Resistors (for LEDs and button pull-down);

  •	Breadboard and jumper wires.
